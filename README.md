# PKML — Product Knowledge

**Generate structured, LLM-optimized project knowledge from codebases and workspaces.**

CCC generates **PKML** — a structured markdown- and JSON-based knowledge format that captures the parts of a codebase that matter most: APIs, schemas, contracts, dependencies, conventions, entry points, architecture, and cross-repo relationships.

---

## Why CCC Exists

Modern codebases are too large, too distributed, and too implicit.

LLMs can help implement, refactor, and explain code — but only if they receive the **right context**. Feeding an entire repository into a model is expensive, noisy, and usually counterproductive.

At the same time, the most valuable engineering knowledge is rarely documented:

- which modules are important
- what conventions a team follows
- where dangerous code lives
- which services depend on which
- in what order changes must land across repositories
- where a new feature should be implemented

CCC exists to make that knowledge **extractable, structured, portable, and reusable**.

---

## What Problem It Solves

CCC is built for three real-world problems:

### 1. LLM Context Compression
Instead of copying large codebases into prompts, CCC produces targeted context files that an LLM can actually use well.

### 2. Repository Understanding
CCC gives developers and AI assistants a compressed understanding of a repository’s structure, APIs, schemas, dependencies, and conventions.

### 3. Multi-Repository Discovery and Coordination
In multi-service systems, CCC helps answer:
- Which repos are involved in this task?
- What needs to change in each one?
- In what order should those changes land?

This is especially important in microservice and platform-heavy organizations where cross-repo knowledge is usually tribal knowledge.

---

## What Is PKML?

**PKML** stands for **Project Knowledge Markdown Language**.

PKML is the structured knowledge format that CCC generates and works with.

It is not a programming language. It is a **portable project knowledge layer** built from markdown and machine-readable companion files.

PKML exists to standardize how repositories describe:

- architecture
- conventions
- boundaries
- dependencies
- schemas
- routes
- symbols
- extension points
- workspace-level relationships

### Why PKML matters

Most repositories have code, but not knowledge.

PKML gives repositories a standard way to expose that knowledge in a format that is:

- readable by humans
- usable by LLMs
- version-controllable
- composable across multiple repositories
- incrementally maintainable

### PKML is designed to be:

- **LLM-friendly** — optimized for prompt context and retrieval
- **human-editable** — important judgment remains editable in markdown
- **machine-generated where possible** — avoid manual drudgery
- **layered** — single-repo and multi-repo knowledge can build on each other
- **non-invasive** — does not require changing your application architecture

### PKML Files

A PKML-enabled repository typically contains:

- `CLAUDE.md` — project-specific conventions and guidance
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` — system-level understanding
- `.llm-context/tree.txt` — file structure
- `.llm-context/routes.txt` — API routes
- `.llm-context/public-api.txt` — exported/public functions
- `.llm-context/schemas-extracted.*` — types and schemas
- `.llm-context/dependency-graph.*` — internal dependency structure
- `.llm-context/symbol-index.json` — symbol navigation
- `.llm-context/entry-points.json` — runtime entry points
- `.llm-context/external-dependencies.json` — repo boundary declaration
- `workspace-context/*` — cross-repo PKML outputs in workspace mode

In other words:

> **CCC is the compiler. PKML is the output format and emerging standard.**

---

## What Is CCC?

CCC is the reference implementation and generator for PKML.

It scans repositories, extracts code intelligence, and builds PKML files automatically.

CCC supports:

- single-repository context generation
- incremental updates
- security-aware operation
- workspace / multi-repository mode
- conflict detection across services
- optional LLM-generated module summaries

---

## Core Concepts

### Single-Repo Mode
CCC analyzes one repository and generates `.llm-context/`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `ARCHITECTURE.md`.

### Workspace Mode
CCC reads multiple PKML-enabled repositories via a `ccc-workspace.yml` manifest and generates cross-repo context and dependency insights.

### Boundary Declarations
Each repository generates an `external-dependencies.json` file describing what it exposes and what it depends on externally. This is the foundation of workspace mode.

### Conflict Detection
CCC can detect cross-repo inconsistencies such as:

- enum mismatches
- type/interface drift
- constant drift
- API route mismatches
- naming inconsistencies

---

## Features

### Single-Repository Features

CCC generates a `.llm-context/` directory with:

- 📁 **File tree** — project structure overview
- 🔷 **Type definitions** — extracted schemas, interfaces, dataclasses
- 🛣️ **API routes** — route map and endpoint overview
- 📝 **Public API** — exported/public function signatures
- 🔗 **Dependency graph** — internal import relationships
- 🗺️ **Symbol index** — symbol navigation by class/function/type
- 🎯 **Entry points** — main files, servers, and executables
- 🗄️ **Database schema** — extracted model/schema information
- 🌐 **External dependencies** — repo boundary contracts
- 📋 **CLAUDE.md** — conventions, gotchas, dangerous areas
- 🏗️ **ARCHITECTURE.md** — architecture scaffold

### Multi-Repository Features

Workspace mode adds:

- service discovery by tags
- dependency ordering
- workspace-level context generation
- cross-repo API mapping
- change sequencing
- dependency graph visualization
- conflict detection across repos

---

## Security Modes

CCC supports three security modes:

### Offline
No external AI APIs. Safe default for proprietary repositories.

### Private-AI
Use internal infrastructure such as Azure OpenAI or self-hosted models.

### Public-AI
Use external providers such as OpenAI or Anthropic.

CCC also supports:

- automatic secret redaction
- audit logging
- exclusion of sensitive files and directories

```

---

## Multi-Repository Mode

CCC supports multi-repository workspaces via a workspace manifest.

### Workspace Manifest

Create `ccc-workspace.yml`:

```yaml
name: streaming-platform
version: 1

services:
  client:
    path: ./client
    type: frontend
    tags: [platforms, ui, player]

  pairing-service:
    path: ./pairing-service
    type: backend-api
    tags: [platforms, devices, pairing]
    depends_on: [cms-db, auth-service]

  cms-db:
    path: ./cms-db
    type: data
    tags: [platforms, content, schema]

  auth-service:
    path: ./auth-service
    type: backend-api
    tags: [auth, security]
```

### Workspace Commands

List services:

```bash
python3 llm-context-setup.py workspace list
```

Query by tags:

```bash
python3 llm-context-setup.py workspace query --tags platforms
```

Inspect a specific service:

```bash
python3 llm-context-setup.py workspace query --service pairing-service --what all
```

Validate the workspace:

```bash
python3 llm-context-setup.py workspace validate
```

Generate workspace context:

```bash
python3 llm-context-setup.py workspace generate
```

---

## Conflict Detection

Workspace mode can detect cross-repo inconsistencies.

### Detect conflicts

```bash
python3 llm-context-setup.py workspace conflicts
```

### Alias

```bash
python3 llm-context-setup.py workspace doctor
```

### Example detected conflicts

- enum mismatch across services
- type/interface field drift
- constant value mismatch
- route mismatch between provider and consumer
- inconsistent naming conventions

### Generated report

```text
workspace-context/
└── conflicts-report.md
```

---

## Workspace Context Output

Workspace mode generates:

```text
workspace-context/
├── WORKSPACE.md
├── cross-repo-api.txt
├── change-sequence.md
├── dependency-graph.md
└── conflicts-report.md
```

### WORKSPACE.md
High-level description of services and how they connect.

### cross-repo-api.txt
Cross-service API call mapping.

### change-sequence.md
Recommended order of changes derived from dependency relationships.

### dependency-graph.md
Mermaid graph of service relationships.

### conflicts-report.md
Detected inconsistencies across repos.

---

## Why `external-dependencies.json` Matters

Every repository can generate:

```text
.llm-context/external-dependencies.json
```

This file is the boundary declaration for a service.

It tells CCC:

- what this repo exposes
- what APIs it consumes
- which services it depends on
- which databases and queues it uses
- which tags it belongs to

This file is the **bridge** between single-repo PKML and workspace PKML.

---

## TypeScript Support

TypeScript is a first-class target and currently the most heavily optimized language in CCC.

CCC detects:

- exported interfaces and types
- enums and constants
- Express routes
- Next.js route handlers and server actions
- NestJS controllers and event patterns
- tRPC procedures and routers
- GraphQL client usage
- Prisma, TypeORM, Drizzle, Mongoose patterns
- fetch / axios / got / ky requests
- queues and event systems
- WebSocket usage
- third-party SDK integration patterns

Because many modern multi-repo systems are TypeScript-heavy, workspace mode is especially effective there.

---

- move doctor/watch/generator into package
- split extractors and generators by concern

### Mid-term
- installable CLI
- stronger TypeScript/NestJS/Next.js support
- richer workspace aggregation
- more complete cross-repo sequencing

### Long-term
- PKML as a documented standard
- multiple PKML producers and consumers
- semantic retrieval and local indexing

- enterprise/private-ai deployment workflows

---

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome.

Especially valuable areas:
- language extractors
- TypeScript framework support
- conflict detection improvements
- PKML documentation
- real-world output examples
- tests for edge cases
- packaging and release automation

---

## Positioning

CCC is not just a repo summarizer.

It is better understood as:

> **a compiler for repository knowledge**

And PKML is the output format that makes that knowledge reusable.

That is the long-term direction:
- repositories become self-describing
- workspaces become navigable
- LLM context becomes structured instead of improvised
- tribal knowledge becomes version-controlled knowledge

## Status

Early but serious.

CCC is already useful today in single-repo and workspace mode, and is being actively evolved toward a stable modular architecture and a more explicit PKML standard.

If you are exploring LLM-assisted development, multi-repo architecture navigation, or structured developer knowledge, this is exactly the problem space CCC is built for.
